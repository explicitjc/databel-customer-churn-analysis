## Analysis Steps

### **Step 1: Data Quality Check**
- **Objective:** Identify duplicate entries in the customer dataset.
- **Approach:** Used COUNT and COUNTD calculated fields.
- **Result:** The dataset contains **6,687 unique customers**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculating Churn Rate**
- **Objective:** Measure the overall churn rate.
- **Approach:** Created a "Churned" column to label churned customers.
- **Results:**
  - Number of churned customers: **1,796**
  - Churn rate: **26.86%**

---

### **Step 3: Investigating Churn Reasons**
- **Objective:** Identify primary reasons for customer churn.
- **Approach:** Created a bar chart to visualize churn reasons.
- **Key Insights:**
  - The **"Competitor"** category accounts for **44.82%** of all churn, making it the most significant reason.

---

### **Step 4: Geographic Analysis**
- **Objective:** Examine churn variations across regions.
- **Approach:** Mapped churn rates by state to evaluate competitor promotions.
- **Key Insight:**
  - **California** has the highest churn rate at **63%**.

---

### **Step 5: Demographic Analysis**
- **Objective:** Assess the impact of demographic factors on churn.
- **Key Insight:**
  - Senior citizens churn at a rate of **38%**, which is **10% higher** than the average.

---

### **Step 6: Age Group Analysis**
- **Objective:** Analyze churn trends by age groups.
- **Approach:** Created age bins and visualized churn rates.
- **Observation:**
  - Churn rates are highest among customers aged **65 and older**, although this group has the lowest customer count.

---

### **Step 7: Group Contracts Analysis with Parameters**
- **Objective:** Analyze whether group contracts affect churn rates and explore their impact on customer bills using interactive parameters.
- **Approach:**
  - Created a dynamic parameter allowing users to toggle between different metrics (e.g., churn rate, average bill).
  - Built a calculated field to dynamically display the selected measure based on the parameter.
- **Key Insights:**
  - Customers with group contracts show a significantly lower churn rate (**6.51%**) compared to the overall average.
  - Despite their lower churn rates, **75% of customers** do not have group contracts, suggesting an opportunity to expand this offering.

---

### **Step 8: Unlimited Plans**
- **Objective:** Analyze the influence of an unlimited plan on churn rate.
- **Approach:**
  - Built a calculated field to understand the distribution of GB downloaded.
- **Key Insights:**
  - People who consume **5GB or less** are more likely to churn.

---

### **Step 9: International Calls**
- **Objective:** Analyze the behavior of customers who call internationally and their churn rate.
- **Approach:**
  - Created a table showing international activity and churn rate.
- **Key Insights:**
  - Despite a high churn rate, this group represents a small customer base and has the highest average monthly charge of all groups.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Propose a cheaper plan for international callers to increase satisfaction and reduce churn.

---

### **Step 10: Contract Types**
- **Objective:** Analyze churn rate based on contract type, payment type, and account length.
- **Approach:**
  - Created a scatter plot to analyze these variables.
- **Key Insights:**
  - **Month-to-month contracts** have the highest churn rate.
  - The **Direct Debit** payment method accounts for the largest group of churned customers (**1,141 churned**).
